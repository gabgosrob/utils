# wc

Clone of the wc tool in unix/linux systems.

## Usage

`wc [-l | -w | -m | -c] [file_path]`

`No flags`  
 Will show the file's line, word and char count.

`-l`  
 Will show the file's line count.

`-w`  
 Will show the file's word count.

`-m`  
 Will show the file's char count.

`-c`  
 Will show the file's byte count.

## What I learned

- How to manage and handle CLI flags
- How to work with files and read them byte per byte
